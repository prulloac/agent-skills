Follow the instructions and workflows defined in these reference files:
1. **Skill Creation:** Follow [skill-creator](.agents/skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md)
2. **Cross-reference Validation:** Follow [markdown-crossref-validator](.agents/skills/markdown-crossref-validator/SKILL.md)

Once the skill is created and validated, provide a table-like summary of the validation results.
