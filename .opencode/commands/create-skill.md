Help me create a new agent skill based on this description: $ARGUMENTS

Follow this workflow:
1. Use the **skill-creator** skill to guide the creation of the skill.
2. Once the skill is created, use the **markdown-crossref-validator** skill to check for broken links.
3. Use the **skill-validator** skill to ensure the skill meets all quality standards.
4. Show a table-like summary of the validation results to the user.
